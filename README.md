# Sinac is not a CAS
## The idea

Doing calculations by hand can be very repetitive and strenuous for both the mind and the muscles. However, the level of automation provided by all known CAS software does not match the way of doing or thinking mathematics when doing it on paper.

The idea behind Sinac is then to replace pen and paper with a graphical, albeit not very automated, way of doing calculations.
This way, the user can minutely control each of the algebraic techniques he or she will use without the physical fatigue of writing long equations.

## What we have so far

Not much. I am slowly working on a python program with a curses interface (maybe in the future it can evolve into a GUI with Latex?) that can do basic algebraic calculations and techniques.

In the meantime, what we have now can be used as an illustration for the kind of automation/non-automation balance that lies at the core of this project.

Any suggestions are welcome! Feel free to post them in the issues section.
